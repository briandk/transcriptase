# Transcriptase

Transcriptase is A [Github Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app for creating and editing transcripts of media files. It supports a [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/help/)-inspired plain text syntax. That means you're not locked into a proprietary format, and your files are human-readable.

Transcriptase runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
