# typescript-with-electron-react-kit

This is a `TypeScript` and `React` starter kit for building Electron apps.

### Why?

I've got dozens of Electron apps started and not finished. They die before they can leave the bikeshed.

This is my attempt to fix that.

### Why Not?

Most other starter kits use things like WebPack, Babel, Flow, and Redux.

This pack o' tools is slightly off the main stream. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not full on hipster, but does have hipster-like tendencies. It's not as far as say, `reason`, `elm`, or `purescript`. I'm not that crazy or brave yet.

### Please Try These Too

Honestly, these are pretty pro.

* https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate
* https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate
* https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter
* https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter

They have been influential and instructional. Pretty cool people at the helm too.

### License

MIT. A tip of the hat is always nice, but I'm more interested in hearing what you do with it.
