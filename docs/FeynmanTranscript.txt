I have a friend who's an artist. And he's sometimes taken  a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say "Look how beautiful this is."

And I'll agree. And he'll say "you see, I as an artist can see how beautiful this is. But you, as a scientist, take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing." And I think he's kind of nutty.

Science knowledge only adds to the excitement and mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.
