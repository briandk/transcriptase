> Describe your app

Transcriptase is a lightweight app for audio and video transcription (turning what you hear and see into words). Load a video or audio file and just start typing. Or, drag an existing transcript onto the editor pane to pick up where you left off.

Transcriptase is great for researchers! Especially sociologists, sociolinguists, oral historians, discourse analysts, conversation analysts, and any field that relies on writing down what people say.
