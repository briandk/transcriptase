# Transcriptase Privacy Policy

## Transcriptase never asks for your information

Transcriptase does not, cannot, and will not collect any personal information about you. Ever.

## Transcriptase doesn't gather information about you

Transcriptase cares about your privacy. It never asks for, nor does it surreptitiously harvest, any information about you.

If you're wondering why we take the time to spell this point out, it's because some applications out there can get personal information about you _without ever asking_ your explicit permission. They can do things like use your battery level, hardware, and IP to create a fingerprint unique to you, then follow you without your consent.

We want no part of that.

Quite frankly, the very idea of doing something without asking you---the user---first disgusts us. We're throwing up in our mouth a little just thinking about it.

## Your data stays yours

You might be working with confidential data. You might need strict security precautions when you transcribe.

Transcriptase has your back. The app has no network code whatsoever; everything you work with stays on your machine. And that's how we believe it should be.

The app doesn't require an internet connection because no data gets sent anywhere. It's all local, under your control. We have zero knowledge of anything you do once the app is installed.
